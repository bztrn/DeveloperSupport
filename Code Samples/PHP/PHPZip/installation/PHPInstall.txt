******************************
Installing the PHP Sample Site
******************************

NOTE: This set of scripts was developed and tested on Apache-AdvancedExtranetServer/2.0.47 (Mandrake Linux/1.6.91mdk) mod_perl/1.99_08 Perl/v5.8.0 mod_ssl/2.0.47 OpenSSL/0.9.7a PHP/4.3.1 

**This set of scripts has been thoroughly tested on Linux. Installations on non - Linux OS's is not guaranteed. Using Windows and IIS is not ideal.


A complete sample site in PHP is located in the 'scripts' directory.  The sample site will allow you to register and administer domain names through eNom's reseller interface.
 
Minimum requirements:

You must have a web server that supports PHP.  The site has been tested on Apache web server Apache/1.3.33 with PHP4.3.x

*******************************
For PHP version 4.3.x or higher
*******************************

You must change the configuration files to the following:
session.auto_start On 
session.bug_compat_42 Off
session.bug_compat_warn off

Safe mode should be off, register globals should be on as well for the best performance.  If those three listed above are not set correctly then the script will not work and you will get errors.

You can EITHER do this by changing the PHP config file, or, if you are using Linux/Apache you will need an .htaccess file set up in the root directory(see bottom of page for setting this up). This file will override the default SESSION state of the PHP processor, so that you can utilize the session code written in these scripts. 


Add the following entries to the .htaccess file:

<IfModule mod_php4.c>
php_flag register_globals on
php_value session.auto_start 1
php_value session.bug_compat_42 0
php_value session.bug_compat_warn 0
</IfModule>

*This assumes you have mod_php4 running on your server

NOTE:  Not all builds of Apache support .htaccess.  If yours does not, then you will need to modify the php.ini file on your server, or have your webhosting provider do so.

*** Changes Made in Apache and the php.ini file will not take effect until after apache is restarted after the changes are made.  To restart apache, type the following in console.

service httpd restart


**********************************
Installing the Site on Your Server
**********************************

Follow these steps to install the Sample Site on your server.  All files for the PHP sample site are located in the 'scripts' directory.

1) Copy the entire contents of 'scripts' into the root web directory of your web server, or any subdirectory.

2) make sure to set permissions:

	A) Set permissions on folders /css and /Setup to 777(UNIX), or read/write/execute(win32)

	B) Set permissions on css/style.css to read and write for Public.

	C) Set permissions on all files in Setup/ to read, write and execute for Public.

	D) Set permissions on root directory and all files in root directory to read and execute for Public.

	E) Set permissions on directory and all files in /include directory to read and execute for Public.

	F) Set permissions on directory and all files in /js directory to read and execute for Public.

	G) Set permissions on directory and all files in /popUps directory to read for Public.

3) Edit /include/sessions.php with your username and password and Sitename

4) Set $PageTitle on all pages; $SiteName and $PageTitle appended together will be the 'title' for each page.

5) Adjust the logo, or put in text : /include/header.php

6) Use the setup scripts to configure your site appearance and TLD offerings:
Browse to the /Setup directory, run BOTH StylesSetup.php and TLDSetup.php

7) Change permissions again: 
Now that you have configured your site, this last change is done for security.folder css and Setup should be set to 755(unix), or read/write(win32)
NOTE: You may also choose to remove the /Setup directory altogether at this point.

8) OPTIONAL STEPS:

Setting your pricing:
In RegisterName.php - find the section on or arround line 258.  Changes prices accordingly as you see fit.
In DNSHosting.php- find the section on or arround line 258.  Changes prices accordingly as you see fit.


Email confirmation on registration:
- Edit RegisterName.php/DNSHosting.php for email settings.  By default an email will be sent to the registrant confirming registration.  Please change the email details for subject, site name, your email address, etc.  If you want to use the email confirmation, make sure that the UseEmail variable is set to 1 to enable, or 0 to disable.

Use eNom's Credit card processing
- If you want to use the Credit Card processing, you should edit the RegisterName.php/DNSHosting.php file.  This file has the charge amounts listed for each TLD.  Change the amount to what you want it to be and turn the variable UseCreditCard equal to 1 to enable.  This is disabled by default.

NOTE: You must be an ETP (main enom) account to use the Credit card processing.  Sub accounts can not use the credit card processing, so if its enalbe and you cant use it, you will get an error stating "This account is not authorized . . ."  You will need to integrate your own 3rd party payment processors.

If you wish to include your own, and share your integration code with us to distribute with our scripts you are more then welcome.  Please contact reseller.support@enom.com for information on that.

At this point the Sample Site should be ready.  Open http://<your_server_ip>/<your_directory>/index.php in your browser and you should see the sample site home page.

************************
Going Live with the code
************************

The server the site connects to can be set in the file EnomInterface_inc.php. The default is our test server at resellertest.enom.com.  When you are ready to go live, change this value to reseller.enom.com. 

YOU MUST send in your IP address for live transactions, submit a support center ticket and Include your user name, and the IP address of the computer that is sending the requests.  This is typically your servers Main IP address, but you may want to contact your hosting provider to find out for sure.

****************
Resolving Errors
****************

If you have trouble getting the PHP files to run, you may have to contact your system administrator to get PHP installed and/or set up on your server.

OR

If you encounter any installation errors on the scripts, please visit our Help/Support Center to submit a ticket to technical support for assistance or visit http://www.enom.com/aboutus.asp for further assistance.

****************
Additional Notes
****************

.name and .name + email forwarding is built in to this distro, but has not been completely tested. It is advised to test thoroughly before using

.uk has not been tested with this release; since it is an email based registration system, it may prove difficlut to develop
There is an include file named uk.php. This could potentially be used in the same fashion that the scripts for .us and .ca are used.

.ca registry is very strict; expect difficulty in some registrations and updates
